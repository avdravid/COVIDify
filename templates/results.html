      <h1>COVID-19 Lung Scanner</h1>
      <p class="info">We built an Auxiliary-Classifier GAN (arXiv:1610.09585) that produces lung x-rays with or without COVID-19 properties based on an inputted condition. After the generator has been trained, an inputted healthy lung x-ray is encoded into a latent vector via gradient descent with a VGG perceptual loss (arXiv:1802.05701, arXiv:1603.08155). Then, a condition vector is concatenated with this latent vector and run through the generator to produce the same lung x-ray but with COVID-19 ground glass opacities. This model was written in Pytorch. Hyperparameters and code can be found at the following GitHub. The training data included around 2000 total 64x64 COVID positive and negative x-rays.
